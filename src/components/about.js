          <h2>How does this App work?</h2>
          <p>This App is really simple. To get started simply click on <Link to = {"/mybooks"}>My Books</Link> or <Link to = {"/"}>Home</Link>. You can view your book list, add books and delete or update existing ones.</p>
          <h2>Why did we create this App?</h2>
          <p>Every avid reader knows the problem: there are just way too many books and no way to keep track... Well, until now!</p>
          <h2>Who are we?</h2>
